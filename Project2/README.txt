PS: a COLORED IMAGE CAN BE INPUT
beware: for some functions, since I couldn't finish implementing color, it will just output a black and white image, otherwise you get a colored image :)

Load and Display Images:
    I am adopting these functions from project 1:
        I tested how to display and load images using the open cv and PIL packages (can be seen in my comments). Both are simple to use and I noticed that I can use less lines of code when using PIL, however, I opted to go with open cv because cv2 is more common from what I've heard and I wanted to understand it better.

        As I kept progressing through the assignment I also noticed that using open cv was a lot more convenient for implementing the other functions in the assignment and also getting to display the image after doing some sort of filtering or transformation.
